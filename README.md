# FORECASTING-SURVIVAL-RATES-USING-KAGGLE-TITANIC-DATASET
The sinking of the Titanic is a famous event in history. The titanic data (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) was collected by the British Board of Trade to investigate the sinking. Many well-known facts—from the proportions of first-class passengers to the ‘women and children first’ policy, and the fact that that policy was not entirely successful in saving the women and children in the third class—are reflected in the survival rates for various classes of passenger. You have been petitioned to investigate this data. Analyze this data with tool(s) that we learned in STA546. Summarize your findings for British Board of Trade. Is their evidence that “women and children” were the first evacuated? What characteristics/demographics are more likely in surviving passengers? What characteristics/demographics are more likely in passengers that perished? How do your results support the popular movie “Titanic” (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120338/)? For example, what is the probability that Rose (1st class adult and female) and (3rd class adult and male) would not survive?
