# FORECASTING-SURVIVAL-OF-PASSENGERS-RATES-USING-KAGGLE-TITANIC-DATASET
The sinking of the Titanic is a famous event in history. The titanic data (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) was collected by the British Board of Trade to investigate the sinking. Many well-known facts—from the proportions of first-class passengers to the ‘women and children first’ policy, and the fact that that policy was not entirely successful in saving the women and children in the third class—are reflected in the survival rates for various classes of passenger. The goal is to investigate this data and Summarize findings for British Board of Trade. 

1. Is their evidence that “women and children” were the first evacuated? 

2. What characteristics/demographics are more likely in surviving passengers? 

3. What characteristics/demographics are more likely in passengers that perished? 

4. what is the probability that 1st class adult and female and 3rd class adult and male would not survive?
